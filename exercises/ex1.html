            <h1>Exercise 1: Media</h1>
            <p>
                We can enhance our websites greatly by adding new types of media. One of neat features we've learned how to add to our
                websites is the audio element. This will let us add sound files to our website so that our users can listen to music. 
                Remember to be judicious when you add media elements with sound, since websites with soundtracks can be jarring to some 
                users.

                Inside the section with an id of answers, create an audio element. In its source element should be the audio file
                Snake_Jazz.mp3. It's type should be audio/mp3.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the section with an id of answers, create another audio element. In its source element should be the audio 
                file Rebecca_Black_Friday.mp3. Use the loop attribute. Be sure to enable controls so you don't get stuck listening 
                to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the section with an id of answers, create another audio element. In its source element should be the audio 
                file Walmart_Yodel.mp3. Use the autoplay and muted attributes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the section with an id of answers, create another audio element. In its source element should be the audio 
                file Keyboard_Cat.mp3. Use the loopstart and loopend attributes. Both require you to set a time (in seconds) for 
                the loop to start and end.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the section with an id of answers, create another audio element. In its source element should be the audio 
                file Rick_Roll. Use the volume attribute, which takes a number between 0 and 1, set as high as you would like for 
                the full Rick Roll experience.
