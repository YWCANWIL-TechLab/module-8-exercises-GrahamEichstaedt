            <h1>Exercise 3: SVG</h1>
            <p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. SVGs are unique in that they use algorithms to draw graphics, so they 
                can be resized to perfectly fit any resolution without stretching or blurring. SVGs are a recommendation of 
                the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international internet standarization organization that creates the 
                standards for most web technologies, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScirpt. SVG is based on XML, another markup 
                language similar to HTML. Since SVG is XML based, it can be accessed through the DOM and can be 
                manipulated dynamically through the DOM. We'll get into exactly what that means in our JavaScript unit, but 
                it opens the door to some really cool possibilities.

            <!-- Question 1 -->
            <p class="q">
                In this set of exercises, we're going to combine several svg elements together to make a more complex graphic.
                Let's try to make a basic checkerboard pattern. I would recommend using percentages for all of your 
                dimensions and coordinates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the section with an id of svg1, create an svg element with a width and height of 100%.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside that same svg, create a rect element. The x and y attributes specify the coordinates of the top left 
                corner of the rectangle. The top left corner is 0%, 0%, while the bottom right corner is 100%, 100%. Please 
                make this rect element 50% high and wide. Use a style to fill it with a color of your choice (other 
                than white), and give it a white border that is 1% thick.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the same svg, create another rect element. Center this rect so it is half as wide as the X axis.
                However, it should have the same height as the first rect element. Give this rect a style to fill it 
                with a second color of your choice
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the same svg, create another rect element. Center this rect so that the top left corner is halfway 
                down the Y axis and at the beginning of the X axis. Give this rect a style so that it has the same color as 
                the rect in the top left corner.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside the same sv, create a final rect element. Center this rect so that the top left corer is halfway down 
                both the X and Y axis. Style the rect so that it has the same color as the second rect element you created.
            </p>

            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <p class="q">
                This time instead of getting step by step directions, try to be creative and make something from a description.
                Try to make 5 circles. You should have one circle in the center, and a circle halfway between the center of 
                the svg and each corner. You can use any color or style that you would like. If you need help making a circle,
                the code to make a basic one is on Slides 11 and 12 of the powerpoint. Just remember that you create circles 
                from the center, instead of the corner like you do with a rect.
            </p>

            <!-- Question 3 -->
            <p class="q">
                This time, try to make some abstract art. You can have anything you want inside your svg, even text if you 
                would like. Refer to the powerpoint for examples of all the different elements you can use.
